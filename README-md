## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt properties like "margin-inline, margin-block, padding-inline and padding-block" does not work properly on all browsers and devices, so i opted for the old-fashioned margin and padding styles



### Continued development

I'll love to work on more complex layout pages using pure HTML, CSS and Javascript
